# /MILPSolver/test_dual

A tester which verifies the dual solution returned by `*MILPSolver`.
These tests are intended to ensure that the convention established by
`RowConstraint` regarding dual solutions is respected by the
`*MILPSolver`.

A makefile is also provided that builds the executable including the
`MILPSolver` module and all its dependencies (and, obviously, the 
core SMS++ library).
